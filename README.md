# mealControl

### What is mealControl & why was it developed?
This application is my submission for the Capstone project assignment at devCodeCamp, while pursuing my Full Stack Development certification. It was origionally inspired by a need that was experienced in my own personal life. mealControl is the first project that I developed from start to finish, with minimal outside assistance.

### What problem does this project solve?
This project is intended to be a simplistic version of a meal planning web application. After conducting research, I found that there are a few good meal planning websites available to meal planners. These applications, however, can consist of many features that might overwhelm a user that is in a hurry.

With that said, this application is intended to serve as a basic meal planning application for users in a hurry. It allows a user to easily search for meals, helps the user decide what they would like to eat, and does so with an easy to navigate user interface.
