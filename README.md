# mealControl

## This project has been discontinued!!

### What is mealControl & why was it developed?
This application is my submission for the Capstone project assignment at devCodeCamp, while pursuing my Full Stack Development certification. It was origionally inspired by a need that was experienced in my own personal life. mealControl is the first project that I developed from start to finish, with minimal outside assistance.

### What problem does this project solve?
This project is intended to be a simplistic version of a meal planning web application. After conducting research, I found that there are a few good meal planning websites available to meal planners. These applications, however, can consist of many features that might overwhelm a user that is in a hurry.

With that said, this application is intended to serve as a basic meal planning application for users in a hurry. It allows a user to easily search for meals, helps the user decide what they would like to eat, and does so with an easy to navigate user interface.

### What did I learn from this project?
This project has allowed me to grow as a developer more than any project that I have worked on to this point. I learned core concepts of software development that are essential in order to excel in the industry.

#### SDLC
While developing this project, I gained an in-depth knowledge of the software development life cycle. I started the project in the planning and analysis phases, where I conducted research to find a need, and planned my application to fulfill that need. Next, I created an ERD and Wireframe in order to design how the application should operate. Then I moved to the implementation and testing phases, where I used a scrum development method to deliver upon user stories. Lastly, I leanred how to deploy & maintain my application using Amazon Web Services.

#### Research is key
While in the implementation phase of the SDLC, I learned that it is rare for a developer to have all of the knowledge readily available to create an application from start to finish with no assistance. As a result, I taught myself how to conduct quick and meaningful research that will allow me to grow my development abilities everyday while working on projects.

#### Much more!
Seeing how mealControl has been my largest project to date, it would be unreasonable for me to list everything that I learned in this ReadME file. Not only have I learned new skills, I also solidified skills that I have previously acquired.

### Conclusion
This a project that will be continously worked on over time, as there are a few bugs and features that I would like to fix. I continue to grow as a software developer everyday, which is a result of my belief in lifelong learning.

To potential employers:
This is only a sample of my development skills that are continuously improving. I can confidently say that after developing this application, I am ready to commit to a development team in order to provide value to any project in question.
